# Product Context: voboost

## Why this Project Exists
The `voboost` application addresses the need for a dedicated, user-friendly interface to configure and fine-tune parameters of Voyah Free and Voyah Dreamer vehicles. Currently, internal machine settings may not provide the desired level of granularity or ease of access for users to customize their vehicle experience. This project aims to bridge that gap by offering a comprehensive and intuitive control panel.

## Problems it Solves
- **Limited Customization:** OEM interfaces often restrict the depth of user customization for vehicle parameters. `voboost` will unlock advanced settings.
- **Inconvenient Access:** Important vehicle settings might be hidden or require complex navigation. `voboost` centralizes and simplifies access.
- **Lack of Feedback:** Users may not have clear feedback on the impact of their setting changes. `voboost` aims to provide clear UI representations of applied settings.
- **Future-Proofing:** Provides a flexible platform for integrating new vehicle features or parameters without requiring core system updates.

## How it Should Work
`voboost` will function as a user-facing application that:
1.  **Reads Configuration:** It will read vehicle configuration parameters from a defined external file.
2.  **Presents UI:** It will display these parameters through a user interface that closely mirrors the aesthetic and layout of the car's existing settings screens, ensuring familiarity and ease of use.
3.  **Allows Modification:** Users will be able to modify parameters through various UI components (sliders, toggles, selectors, drag-and-drop elements).
4.  **Writes Configuration:** User-initiated changes will be written back to the external configuration file. It's crucial that this process is efficient and allows for partial updates.
5.  **Reactive Updates:** The UI should react dynamically to changes in the configuration file, whether initiated by the user or an external process (e.g., `voboost-service`).

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Users should find the application easy to navigate, with clearly organized sections (tabs for Store, Applications, Interface, Vehicle, Settings).
- **Familiar Look and Feel:** The UI should feel like a natural extension of the car's infotainment system, not a separate, disjointed application. This includes adhering to existing design language, fonts, and interaction patterns.
- **Responsive and Adaptive:** The interface must adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, including any specified X/Y offsets.
- **Clear Feedback:** Users should receive immediate and clear visual feedback for any changes they make or that are applied to the system.
- **Robustness:** The application must be stable and reliable, reflecting its critical role in vehicle customization. Null-safety and proper error handling are paramount.
- **Multilingual Support:** Provide a comfortable experience for both English and Russian speaking users.
- **Theme Flexibility:** Allow users to switch between Light and Dark themes according to their preference or environmental conditions.
