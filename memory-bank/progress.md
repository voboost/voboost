# Progress: voboost

## What Works / What has been done
- **Core project understanding established:** The fundamental purpose, principles, and high-level requirements for the `voboost` application have been gathered and documented.
- **Language Implementation:** Kotlin 1.9.0 fully integrated with:
  - Coroutines for async operations
  - Flow for reactive programming
  - Null safety throughout codebase
  - Kotlinx Serialization for config
- **Architectural overview:** A high-level system architecture, emphasizing modularity and the creation of a shared `voboost-config` library, has been defined.
- **Technical stack outlined:** Key technologies and libraries (e.g., Android SDK, Jetpack components, Coroutines, JSON, OkHttp) have been identified.
- **Memory Bank populated (initial phase):** The following core Memory Bank files have been successfully created, establishing a documented baseline for the project:
    - [`memory-bank/projectbrief.md`](memory-bank/projectbrief.md)
    - [`memory-bank/productContext.md`](memory-bank/productContext.md)
    - [`memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`](memory-bank/systemPatterns.md)
    - [`memory-bank/techContext.md`](memory-bank/techContext.md)
    - [`memory-bank/activeContext.md`](memory-bank/activeContext.md)

## What's Left to Build / Remaining Tasks
Current Phase: `UI Implementation & Config Development`
- **Completed:**
  - Kotlin environment setup
  - Project structure creation
  - Memory Bank documentation
  - Architectural decisions finalized

- **In Progress:**
  - Config library implementation
  - MainActivity and tab structure
  - ThemeManager development
    - Actual instantiation of the Android project in Android Studio.
    - Creation of the `voboost-config` module.
    - Setup of `MainActivity` and initial tab structure (XML layouts).
- **Core `voboost-config` implementation:** Developing the configuration reading, writing, and reactive update mechanisms.
- **`voboost` UI and Feature Development:** Implementing all defined UI components, internationalization, theming, dynamic UI adjustments, and `Store` tab functionalities.
- **Integration and Testing:** Connecting modules, writing comprehensive tests, and ensuring system stability.

## Current Status
All foundational documentation for the project, as defined by RooCode's Memory Bank structure, is nearing completion. The architectural thinking is well-defined, and the initial technological choices have been made and justified. The project is ready for the user to review the detailed plan before proceeding to code implementation.

## Known Issues / Open Questions
- **Pending Research:**
  - Huawei AppGallery integration details
  - Vehicle ECU communication protocol
  - Advanced theme customization needs
  - Performance optimization strategies
- **Huawei Server Details:** The exact API specifications or contact points for the "Huawei" update server for the "Store" tab are not yet known.
- **`voboost-service` communication:** While `voboost-config` will be shared, the precise mechanism for `voboost` to trigger actions in `voboost-service` (e.g., applying configuration changes to the car's ECU) is not defined yet and will depend on Android's IPC capabilities and security considerations. This is outside the scope of `voboost` itself but is a future concern for the overall system.
